# KingOfTheHomer
Easily configurable King of the Hill themed [Homer dashboard](https://github.com/bastienwirtz/homer).

### Installation
---
The "install.sh" script is based off of my [ProxmoxMaster](https://github.com/tylerdotrar/ProxmoxMaster) repository.
This script automatically installs Homer from scratch while providing user input and automation for port selection and SSL utilization.

One-liner to freshly install **Homer** and  **KingOfTheHomer** (tested on an Ubuntu 22.04 LXC):
```shell
<tbd>
```

### Configurations
---
I couldn't quite determine what style I wanted for the template, so I made sure the 'config.yml' file was fairly commented to provide easy customization.

- Standard light theme without a searchbar

- Cursed dark theme with a DuckDuckGo searchbar
